# Project Summary
Understanding the struggles of analysing volatility to churn profits, we seek to ease the lives of option traders by predicting the current market volatility, and through which, implement the best strategy to fight for the best possible payout in the uncertain market.

# Ideation
Through feeding through historical RV, we would generate the predicted RV of today's market. By comparing the predicted RV and market's IV, we would understand the market's true sentiment to the stock, and thereafter, recommend the best strategy to implement for max payout.
